# Location from GPS

**Donations**: if you like these scripts and want to support them [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/walterrowe).

For the selected variants scan for GPS coordinates. If GPS coordinates are present then use Google Maps to get location attributes for city, county, state, country, country code.

* Apply a hierarchical keyword for country > state > county > city
* Set variant IPTC fields for city, state, country, country code
