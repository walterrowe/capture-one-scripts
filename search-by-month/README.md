# Search by Month

Auth: Walter Rowe<br>
Date: December 2023

This script prompts for a month, and a start and end year. It then creates a smart album that searches for images created in that month in every year in the specified range. The smart album will be named "\<Month\> of \<Start Year\> to \<End Year\>" (eg. "Feb of 2020 to 2023").
